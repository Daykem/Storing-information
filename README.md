# Storing Informations

### 
Storing Information is a software component for storing information about student grades. Each topic that a student is graded on has a Rubric. A Rubric is made up of multiple Criteria (up to a maximum of 10). When a student is graded they are awarded a score for each Criterion in the Rubric, which is an integer value between 1 and 5.
